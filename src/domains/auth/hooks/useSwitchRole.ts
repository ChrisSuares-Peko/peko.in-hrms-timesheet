/**
 * Switches the session into another identity owned by the same credential (corporate <-> employee), without
 * re-entering a password.
 *
 * Finishes with a full page load rather than an in-app navigation. Almost everything already fetched belongs
 * to the identity being left behind — the services tree, the entitlements, the profile, the card KYC and KYB
 * stage — and it is all held in slices that are NOT persisted, so a load rebuilds them and an in-app
 * navigation does not. Switching used to navigate, and `useUserInfo` refetches only when it finds `null`, so
 * the previous identity's sidebar simply stayed on screen. Clearing each slice by hand works only until the
 * next identity-scoped slice is added and nobody remembers this list.
 *
 * `auth` IS persisted, so the new session survives the load — flushed first, because redux-persist writes on
 * a throttle and reloading before it lands would drop the session that was just minted.
