/**
 * Scoped TypeScript check for pre-commit (lint-staged).
 *
 * Instead of running `tsc --noEmit` over the whole project on every commit,
 * this type-checks only the staged .ts/.tsx files plus everything they import
 * (their transitive dependencies). It catches the cases we care about at commit
 * time: undefined variables (TS2304), invalid/missing named imports (TS2305),
 * unresolved module paths, and type errors inside the touched files.
 *
 * It works by generating a temporary tsconfig that EXTENDS the project config
 * (so compilerOptions, path aliases and `types` are preserved) and declares its
 * own `include`. Declaring `include` is required: without it the temp config
 * inherits the base config's broad include (`**\/*.ts`) and ends up checking the
 * whole project again. We include `src/**\/*.d.ts` so ambient `declare module`
 * declarations (react-lottie, react-reveal, etc.) still resolve.
 *
 * NOTE ON SCOPE: this checks the staged files and the files THEY import. It does
 * not check files that import the staged files (reverse dependencies). Changing
 * a shared signature can still break a non-staged caller — keep a full
 * `tsc --noEmit` in CI / pre-push as the safety net for that case.
